**Follow-ups** are a tool that Altur offers so your agent can schedule and execute WhatsApp calls or messages according to the conversation it has with each contact in your campaign.

This feature is configurable within each **agent** and you can **customize it** according to the execution parameters you define.

---

## Before you start

- **Permissions:** make sure you have permissions to edit the agent/project.
- **Integrations:** if you will use WhatsApp and/or calls, confirm that your lines/templates are **approved** and connected.
- **Consent:** use outbound WhatsApp only with contacts who have given **prior consent** to avoid the risk of being blocked by Meta.

### Accessing Follow-up Settings

1. **Access your agent's configuration**: Go to the **Agents** section in the left sidebar.
   - If your agent is already created, access its configuration by clicking on it.
   - If your agent is not yet created, click **New agent** to start the configuration.
3. **Go to the Follow-up tab**: Once inside your agent, you will see the configuration sections on the left side. Locate **Follow-ups** and access it by clicking.
