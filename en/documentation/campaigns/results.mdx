title: "Campaign Results Interpretation"
description: "A brief guide on how to correctly interpret campaign results in Altur."
---

After running a campaign, Altur allows you to download multiple `.csv` files. This guide details the content of each one and how to correctly interpret the results.

### Contact Export

This CSV file contains **all contacts** added to the campaign along with their current status and associated metrics.

#### File Columns

**Basic Columns:**

- `campaign_name`: Campaign name.
- `campaign_date`: Campaign creation date (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- `id`: Unique contact identifier from the import file (if provided).
- `contact`: Phone number in E.164 format.
- `name`: Contact name.
- `context`: Context or additional contact information.
- `status`: Current contact status in the campaign (see status section).
- `retries`: Number of retries performed.
- `calls`: Total number of calls made to the contact (call campaigns only).
- `billed_duration`: Total billable duration in readable format (call campaigns only).
- `last_update`: Date and time of last status update.
- `follow_up`: Indicates if the contact has a scheduled follow-up (`True`/`False`).

**Dynamic Columns:**

- **Tags**: One column per tag configured in the agent. The value will be `True` if the contact has that tag, `False` otherwise.
- **Extractable Fields**: One column per data field configured for extraction in the agent (e.g., "email", "interest", "rating").

#### Campaign Contact Statuses

Contacts can have different statuses depending on the campaign channel.

##### Common Statuses (Both Channels)

| Status      | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `queue`     | Queued, waiting to be processed             |
| `sending`   | Sending message or initiating call          |
| `failed`    | General failure in sending/call             |
| `retrying`  | Retrying after failed status or no response |
| `converted` | Contact marked as converted by the system   |

##### Call-Specific Statuses

| Status      | Description                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `voicemail` | Call answered by voicemail |
| `answered`  | Call answered              |

##### WhatsApp-Specific Statuses

| Status      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `delivered` | Message delivered                 |
| `read`      | Message read                      |
| `accepted`  | Contact accepted the conversation |
| `rejected`  | Contact rejected the conversation |

<Info>
  **Conditional:** These statuses can change to `queue` or `retrying` if the
  system determines there are available retries according to the campaign
  configuration.
</Info>

#### Understanding Retries

- `retries`: Retry counter specific to calls that reach voicemail. The limit is configured in the campaign.
- `failed_retries` (not visible in CSV): Internal system that retries contacts with `failed` status. Limit defined in system configuration (typically 1).

**Retry Logic:**

1. If a contact reaches `voicemail` and `retries < campaign_limit`, the status will change to `retrying` and the contact will be attempted again.
2. If a contact has `failed`, and has not exceeded the system retry limit, it will return to `queue`.
3. When limits are exceeded, the status remains as final.

### Call Export

This CSV file contains **each individual call** made during the campaign, allowing detailed analysis of each interaction.

#### File Columns

**Basic Columns:**

- `campaign_name`: Campaign name.
- `campaign_date`: Campaign creation date.
- `id`: Unique call ID.
- `number_to`: Destination phone number (E.164).
- `contact_name`: Contact name.
- `type`: Call type (`inbound` / `outbound`).
- `status`: Final call status (see status section).
- `answered_by`: Who answered the call (see next section).
- `created_at`: Call creation date and time.
- `started_at`: Call start date and time (when answered).
- `ended_at`: Call end date and time.
- `duration`: Total duration in readable format (MM:SS).
- `billed_duration`: Billable duration in readable format (MM:SS).
- `recording_url`: URL to download the call recording.

**Dynamic Columns:**

- **Tags**: One column per tag configured in the agent.
- **Extractable Fields**: Data extracted during the conversation.

#### Call Statuses

Individual calls can have the following statuses (`status`):

| Status        | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `created`     | Call created in the system |
| `queued`      | Call queued to be dialed   |
| `ringing`     | Phone ringing              |
| `in-progress` | Call in progress           |
| `forwarding`  | Call being transferred     |
| `ended`       | Call ended successfully    |
| `busy`        | Line busy                  |
| `no-answer`   | No answer                  |
| `failed`      | Call error                 |

#### Response Types (answered_by)

This field is critical to understand who answered the call:

| Value     | Description                   | Billing Impact             |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `human`   | Answered by a human           | Full rate                  |
| `machine` | Answered by answering machine | Rate limited to 5 seconds  |
| `unknown` | Could not be determined       | According to configuration |

**Important note on billing:**

- Calls answered by answering machines (`machine`) have a reduced rate.
- The billable duration (`billed_duration`) automatically applies the limit to voicemail calls.
- Only calls with `answered_by: human` are included in the recording export.

#### Difference between Duration and Billed Duration

- `duration`: Total time from when the call was answered until it ended.
- `billed_duration`: Time billed as consumption:
  - For `human`: equal to `duration`.
  - For `machine`: `duration` limited to 5 seconds.

### Results Export

This CSV file is a **filtered version** of the contact export that includes **only contacts with extracted data**.

#### Differences from Contact Export

- **Includes**: Only contacts with extracted data.
- **Purpose**: Analysis of conversions and positive campaign results.
- **Columns**: Identical to the contact export.

#### Use Cases

This export is useful for:

- Analyzing qualified leads that completed the conversation flow.
- Obtaining structured information collected during conversations (emails, dates, preferences, etc.).
- Calculating effective conversion rates.
- Integrating with CRMs or other downstream systems.

#### Campaign Statuses

| Status                | Description                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Pending (pending)`   | Campaign created, awaiting contacts |
| `Ready (ready)`       | Contacts loaded, ready to activate  |
| `Active (active)`     | Campaign running                    |
| `Inactive (inactive)` | Campaign manually paused            |
| `Cooldown (cooldown)` | Between cycles, waiting to resume   |
| `Finished (finished)` | All cycles completed                |

#### Cycle Interpretation in Results

When a campaign has cycles enabled:

- Contacts that do not reach a "successful final status" will be retried.
- The `retries` field resets on each cycle.
- Statuses within the filter for cycles will not return to queue in the next cycle.

### Best Practices for Analysis

1. **To measure reach**: Use **Contact** export and count statuses:
   - **For Calls:**
     - `answered`
     - `converted`
   - **For WhatsApp:**
     - `delivered`
     - `accepted`
     - `read`
     - `converted`
2. **To measure conversion**: Use **Contact** export and filter/count contacts in `converted` status or use **Results** and analyze extracted fields.
3. **For cost auditing**: Use **Call** export and sum `billed_duration` by `answered_by`.
