Campaigns are a core feature of Altur. They allow you to automatically launch large-scale conversations without sacrificing personalization in each interaction.

## Types of Campaigns

Altur currently supports two channels for campaigns: **Phone Calls** and **WhatsApp**.

<Warning>
  We recommend using **WhatsApp campaigns** only when your contact list has previously given consent to receive messages from your company. This is due to strict regulations around high-volume outbound messaging, and non-compliance may result in account sanctions or blocks.
</Warning>

## Configuring a Campaign

Follow these steps to create a new campaign in Altur:

1. **Go to the Campaigns section:** Navigate to the **Campaigns** section on the left sidebar and click **New Campaign** in the top-right corner.

<Note>
  If you don't see these options, ask your organization‚Äôs administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.
</Note>

2. **Fill in the basic fields:**
   - **Campaign name:** Choose a short, descriptive name.
   - **Description:** Add internal details or the goal of the campaign.
3. **Select an agent:** Choose the pre-configured **agent** that will handle the conversations for this campaign.
4. **Select an integration:** Pick the phone number or WhatsApp line from which messages or calls will be sent.

<Note>
  If you're using WhatsApp, make sure the account and number are properly configured and integrated with Altur.
</Note>

 5. **Set the time zone:** Choose the time zone of your contact base. By default, it is set to **America/Mexico_City**.
 6. **Initial message (Phone Calls):** Enter the initial message that the agent will say when the call connects.
 7. **Template (WhatsApp):** Select one or two pre-approved WhatsApp message templates.\
    If the selected template contains an image header, an image upload field will be enabled. Make sure the image matches Meta's approved content.
 8. **Configure retries:** Set how many times the system will attempt to contact a customer in case of no response or voicemail.
 9. **(Optional) Configure retry loops (Phone Calls only):** You can enable automatic loops so the campaign retries contacting unconverted leads. When enabled, you can configure:
    - Max number of loops per day
    - Cooldown time between loops (in minutes)
    - Status filters (e.g. skip users who already answered)
    - Tag filters (e.g. skip numbers marked as invalid)
10. **Set daily send limits (WhatsApp):** Define how many messages can be sent per day. This helps avoid saturating the integration or exceeding WhatsApp limits.
11. **Save the campaign:** Click **Save** to create the new campaign with your configuration.

<Check>
  Done\! Your campaign has been created.
</Check>

<Info>
  Once saved, the campaign will remain in **‚Äúpending‚Äù** state until you upload your contact list.

## Uploading Contacts

To run a campaign, you need to upload a list of contacts. Altur supports `.csv` files encoded in UTF-8 or similar formats.

### üìÑ CSV File Structure

Your file must include the following **required** columns:

| Column    | Description                                                                                                        |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contact` | Phone number in any format. Altur will automatically convert it to international E.164 format.                     |
| `name`    | The contact's name, used to personalize the conversation.                                                          |
| `context` | Additional information the agent can use in the conversation (e.g. offer details, payment amount, due date, etc.). |

You may also include these **optional** columns:

| Column                    | Description                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                      | A unique identifier from your system. Altur will store it for internal reference.                                       |
| `override_agent_name`     | A custom name for the agent when speaking to this contact (overrides the default agent name).                           |
| `override_agent_voice_id` | The voice ID to be used specifically for this contact. Only available for phone campaigns. Must match a valid voice ID. |

<Warning>
  Invalid phone numbers or duplicate contacts will be skipped automatically.
</Warning>

### üß™ Example of a valid file

```contacts.csv
contact,name,context,id,override_agent_name,override_agent_voice_id
+528715551234,Juan P√©rez,"Amount: $1,500. Due: June 5",123,In√©s,female_voice
+525555555678,Ana G√≥mez,"Amount: $900. Due: June 7",124,Andres,male_voice
+523385559012,Carlos Ruiz,"Amount: $2,300. Due: June 6",125,In√©s,female_voice
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use a comma (`,`) as a delimiter, which is the default in most CSV editors (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.).
- Avoid special characters in the column headers.
- Make sure there are no leading or trailing spaces in the values.
- Validate your contact data before uploading it.

## Launching the Campaign

Once the campaign is fully configured and the contact list has been uploaded:

### ‚úÖ Final Review

- Review the **campaign summary** to confirm the configuration, time zone, and number of contacts.
- Ensure everything looks good before proceeding.

### üöÄ Launch

- Click **Start Campaign** to begin sending calls or messages according to the configured schedule.

### üìä Real-Time Monitoring

From the campaign dashboard you can:

- View the total number of interactions.
- Track failed attempts, voicemails, retries, and converted contacts.
- Monitor the overall progress of the campaign.

### üìÅ Exporting Results

- During or after the campaign, you can **export a CSV file** containing:
  - Contact handling results
  - Details of calls or messages sent
  - Extracted data from interactions

This helps you extract results, analyze campaign performance, or create follow-up lists.

### üîÅ Repeat or Archive

- If the campaign uses **loops**, they will run automatically according to your settings.
- If not, you can:
  - **Repeat the campaign** by uploading a filtered CSV (e.g. only non-converted contacts).
  - **Archive the campaign** if no further actions are needed.
