## Base URL

The Altur API is built on REST principles and requires HTTPS for all requests, ensuring data security, integrity, and privacy. HTTP requests are not supported.

### API Base URL

```plaintext
https://api.altur.io/api/v1.0
```

## Authentication

All requests to the Altur API must include a valid API key to authenticate your organization. Follow the steps below to generate and use your API key.

### Steps to Generate an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log In to Your Account">
    Log in to your Altur account using your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the API Dashboard">
    Navigate to the [API Keys](https://app.altur.io/dashboard/api) section in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an API Key">
    Click "Generate API Key" to create a new key. Copy it and save it securely, as it will not be displayed again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include the following `Authorization` header in your requests to authenticate:

```plaintext
Authorization: api-key YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY
```

### Example Request

Here's an example of an authenticated `GET` request:

```curl
curl -X GET "https://api.altur.io/api/v1.0/example-endpoint" \
-H "Authorization: api-key YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Best Practices for API Keys

1. **Keep Your Key Secure**

Store your API key in a secure environment, such as environment variables or a secrets manager. Avoid hardcoding keys directly into your application.

2. **Rotate Keys Regularly**

Periodically regenerate your API key to minimize the risk of misuse. Update all systems that use the key to the new value.

3. **Restrict Access**

Assign keys only to trusted systems and personnel. If you suspect your key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.
