title: "Webhook Overview"
description: "Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events in the Altur platform. When a specific event occurs (e.g., the end of a call), Altur sends an HTTP POST request with event-specific data to your configured endpoint. This enables seamless integration with your backend systems or CRM to ensure they stay up-to-date."
