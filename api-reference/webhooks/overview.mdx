## The Basics

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events in the Altur platform. When a specific event occurs (e.g., the end of a call), Altur sends an HTTP POST request with event-specific data to your configured endpoint. This enables seamless integration with your backend systems or CRM to ensure they stay up-to-date.

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Configure Your Endpoint**  
    You can configure your webhook URL in the Altur platform. This URL will receive POST requests when specific events are triggered.

2. **Receive Notifications**  
    When an event occurs, Altur sends a POST request to your endpoint containing the event's details in a structured JSON format.

3. **Acknowledge Delivery**  
    Your endpoint should respond with a `200 OK` status code to confirm successful receipt. If the request fails or times out, Altur retries the delivery up to 5 times using an exponential backoff strategy.

## Security

To ensure secure communication and verify the authenticity of webhook requests, Altur includes an HMAC signature in the `X-Altur-Signature` header for every request.

### How It Works
- **Shared Secret**: Each webhook integration is configured with a unique shared secret key.
- **HMAC Generation**: Altur generates an HMAC SHA-256 hash using the shared secret and the request payload. This hash is included in the `X-Altur-Signature` header.
- **Validation**: Your endpoint must validate the signature using the same shared secret.

### Validation Example (Python)
```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def is_valid_signature(secret, payload, signature):
    computed_signature = hmac.new(
        key=secret.encode('utf-8'),
        msg=payload.encode('utf-8'),
        digestmod=hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(computed_signature, signature)

# Example usage:
payload = '{"type": "on_call_end", ...}'  # The raw request payload
signature = "provided-signature-from-header"
shared_secret = "your-shared-secret-key"

if is_valid_signature(shared_secret, payload, signature):
    print("Valid webhook request!")
else:
    print("Invalid webhook request!")
```

### Headers Sent with Webhook
- `Content-Type`: `application/json`
- `X-Altur-Signature`: HMAC SHA-256 hash of the payload

### Why This Matters

This mechanism ensures:
- The request is sent by Altur.
- The payload is not tampered with during transmission.

## Event Types

Webhooks can be triggered by the following event types:

- `on_call_end`: Triggered at the end of a call, this webhook sends detailed information about the call and basic information about the assistant and enduser.

## Retry Policy

To ensure reliable delivery, Altur employs a retry mechanism for failed webhook requests. If your endpoint does not respond with a `200 OK` status code, the following retry policy is applied:

- **Retry Attempts**: 5
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff
  - Initial Retry: 2 seconds after the first failure.
  - Maximum Retry Delay: 30 seconds between retries.

If all retries fail, the webhook event will not be delivered. It is recommended to ensure that your endpoint is reliable and can process requests promptly.

## Example Workflow

Hereâ€™s a typical workflow for handling webhooks:

1. **Set Up Your Endpoint**: Create an API endpoint in your backend, such as `/webhooks/altur/on_call_end`.
2. **Parse Incoming Data**: Process the JSON payload sent by Altur.
3. **Validate Authenticity**: Use the `X-Signature` header to verify the request's authenticity.
4. **Respond Promptly**: Return a `200 OK` status to acknowledge receipt.
5. **Handle Retries**: Ensure your system can handle retries in case of temporary failures.

## Best Practices

- **Secure Your Endpoint**: Verify webhook authenticity using HMAC signatures.
- **Log Events**: Log incoming webhook requests for debugging and auditing.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use the Altur dashboard to simulate webhook events and verify your integration.
- **Optimize Performance**: Ensure your endpoint responds within 10 seconds to avoid timeouts.
